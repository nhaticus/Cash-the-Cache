----------  Interactable Objects Documentation  -------------
If you want any object to be interactable when the player left clicks on it there are some important steps.

(1) The player shoots out a raycast. If the raycast hits an object with a collider it will give the player a reference to it.
If the player presses the Interact button then it checks if the object is stealable.
  True: Saves the objects information and executes its "interact event"
  False: Executes its "interact event"
If there is no "interact event" attached to the object, nothing happens.

(2) Want a stealable item with no special behaviors?
Attach the StealableObject.cs script to it which has information about the game object, name, value, and weight.
You can also attach a script to destroy the object when clicked.
When the player interacts with it: player's inventory saves the StealableObject info and executes the "interact event" to destroy the game object.

(3) Want an object with special behaviors when clicked?
Create a new script and give it the InteractEvent like this:
   public class Apple : MonoBehaviour, InteractEvent
Give the object the public void Interact() function and put whatever behavior you want.
An example is the door
When the player interacts with it: the door's "interact event" makes it change rotation

(4) TIP: You can are not restricted when making a StealableObject. It doesn't have to be destroyed when clicked.
You can give it an InteractEvent that plays a sound or no interact event so it stays in game forever
